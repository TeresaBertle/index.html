<h2>Happy and sad ending movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Midnight sun</h3>
<p>Great story with a sad ending where a boy and a girl fall in love but the girl is sensitive to sunlight and dies at the end</p>
<h3>Me before you</h3>
<p>This is a comedy plus a sad yet happy ending film...my fav.</p>
<h3>Hridayam</h3>
<p>To be honest no other film can take over the place i have given to this film in my heart....and was recommended to me by my dear best frnd.</p>
